                <h3>Curious about me? Here you have it:</h3>
                <p>I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Spring Boot). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.
                </p>

                <p>I began my journey as a web developer in 2023, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. </p>

                <p>I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
                </p>

                <p>When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on linkedin, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. You can connect me on linkedin where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.
                </p>
